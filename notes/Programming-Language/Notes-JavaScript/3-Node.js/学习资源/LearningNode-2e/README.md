# Learning Node 2nd edition Examples

Subdirectories include example code for the book, "Learning Node, 2nd edition" by Shelley Powers.

Starting in March, examples are being modified/updated/added to account for the Node v4 end of life (EOL), as well as the release of Node v10. 

All chapters have been reviewed with new or modified examples, as well as per chapter README files with updated information (March 20).

Thankfully, Node and the modules I covered in the book are very stable, and there are very few changes. The biggest change is the runtime deprecation of the Buffer constructor, covered in the chap2 README file.

The book and these example files are still as viable for Node v10.0 as they were for Node v4.0. 

Happy coding

Shelley
