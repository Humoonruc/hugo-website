# Learning Node 2nd edition

## Updates to examples for upcoming Node.js 10 release

### Chapter 9

Added a couple of subdirectories to prevent errors in applications dependent on 
subdirectories. 

This chapter seems a bit quaint now, because we're all so used to working with 
ES 6 (ECMAScript 2015) and even later. Still, it's useful to see how the ES 6 changes work in Node. 

The http://node.green website lists all of the ES2015 support in Node by defaultby version. In addition, as you scroll down, you can also see all of the ES2016 and ES2017 support. At the very bottom is a list of ES2018 (ESNEXT) additions 
supported by default in Node v10, and using a flag in earlier Node versions.
